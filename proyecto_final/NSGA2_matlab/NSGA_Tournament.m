% Selection via binary tournaments of pairs of parent individuals 
% that can be used to create offspring via, e.g., the SBX crossover operator.
%
% ARGUMENTS
%
% Ranking - the rank for each individual (see NSGA_Rank.m)
% nmbOfPairs - desired number of pairs of parents
%
% RETURN VALUES
%
% Pars - the pair of parents for each prospective child individual
%   Mx2 array where M = number of individuals; contains indices into 'Ranking' 
%   and thus, indices into the underlying generation
% Tourn - the actual pairing of individuals during the tournaments
%   2xN array where N = 2 * nmbOfPairs
